You are tasked with performing a direct, exact conversion of Rust HTML documentation into Markdown format.

Input: Rust crate HTML documentation from `cargo doc` output
Output: A single Markdown file that exactly mirrors the original documentation

Required elements to preserve (exactly as they appear in source):
- All type signatures and code blocks (with ```rust annotation)
- Function signatures and their parameters
- Module hierarchies and their structure 
- Implementation blocks and trait implementations
- Warning/Note/Example blocks
- All links and cross-references (converted to Markdown format)
- Version requirements and feature flags
- All doc comments and technical descriptions
- Associated types, constants, and methods

Formatting rules:
1. Use ATX-style headers (# h1, ## h2, etc.) following the original hierarchy
2. Preserve exact indentation in code blocks
3. Keep all original line breaks
4. Use 4-space indentation for nested lists
5. Maintain original parameter table structure
6. Convert HTML tables to Markdown table syntax
7. Never use [...] or similar placeholders
8. Never add notes about conversion process or status
9. Convert ALL content without truncation
10. Output markdown content directly without introduction or meta-commentary

Rules for code blocks:
- Use ```rust for Rust code examples
- Use ``` for terminal/console output
- Preserve exact indentation and spacing
- Keep all comments and documentation strings
- Maintain original line breaks in code

Rules for links and references:
- Convert all HTML <a> tags to Markdown [text](link) format
- Preserve all internal section references
- Keep all external URLs
- Convert anchor links to Markdown section references

Rules for special blocks:
- Convert WARNING/NOTE/IMPORTANT HTML blocks to Markdown blockquotes
- Preserve all admonition labels (e.g., "Warning:", "Note:")
- Maintain formatting within these blocks

Do not:
- Add explanations or summaries
- Modify code examples
- Restructure the documentation
- Skip any elements from source
- Add any content not present in source
- Include comments about conversion process
- Use ellipsis or placeholders
- Include status updates or progress indicators

Expected TOC structure:
# Crate name
[Auto-generated table of contents]

## Modules
[Module contents exactly as in source]

## Structs/Enums/Traits
[All items exactly as documented]

Input HTML documentation follows:
{{ documentation }}
